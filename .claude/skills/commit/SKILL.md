Commit instruction:
1. Check if any files added and needed to be goes to .gitignore file, if you found any, ask me to keep it or move it to ignore file
2. Read all changes, and extract different logics their trying to implement (like logic 1 is handling user auth and logic 2 is debugging celery config)
3. For each logic, stage its files, and generate a cool commit message, don't forget to put feat/debug/refactor/... and don't hesitate to use icons!
4. Apply the commit per each logic
