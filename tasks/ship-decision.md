## Verdict: SHIP
## Confidence: HIGH
## Quality Score: 9/10
## Summary: Full-stack message editing and deletion across Django backend, Flutter mobile, and Next.js web. All 32 acceptance criteria verified. 107 tests pass. All audit scores 8-9/10. Multiple critical issues found and fixed during pipeline (race conditions, test URL mismatch, serializer validation gap, WS state sync, accessibility gaps). Zero known bugs remain.
## Remaining Concerns: Mobile conversation list preview does not update in real-time when the other party edits/deletes the last message (requires explicit refresh). Documented as future improvement — non-blocking.
## What Was Built: Message Editing and Deletion — users can edit sent messages within a 15-minute window and soft-delete messages at any time. Backend: PATCH/DELETE on single RESTful endpoint with row-level security, impersonation guards, race condition prevention (select_for_update), image file cleanup on delete, WebSocket broadcasts. Mobile: long-press context menu with Edit/Delete/Copy, edit bottom sheet with character counter, "(edited)" indicator, "[This message was deleted]" placeholder, optimistic updates with rollback, real-time WS sync. Web: hover action icons, inline edit mode (Esc/Cmd+Enter), delete confirmation dialog, ARIA accessibility, optimistic updates, React Query cache sync across all pages.
