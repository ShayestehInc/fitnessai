# Focus: White-Label Infrastructure

## Priority: HIGH (Priority #1 — next after workout layouts shipped 2026-02-14)

## What
Per-trainer branding system. Each trainer can customize the app appearance for their trainees: primary/secondary colors, logo, app name. Trainees see their trainer's branding instead of "FitnessAI."

## Why
FitnessAI is a white-label platform — trainers are the paying customers and want their brand front-and-center. Without white-labeling, the app looks generic. Trainers can't differentiate their business. This is a core value proposition for trainer acquisition and retention.

## Who Benefits
- **Trainers**: Present a professional, branded experience to clients. Builds trust and loyalty.
- **Trainees**: See their trainer's brand, reinforcing the trainer-client relationship.
- **Platform**: Increases trainer willingness to pay (their brand, not ours).

## Success Metric
Trainer configures branding → trainee logs in → sees trainer's colors, logo, and app name throughout the app.
