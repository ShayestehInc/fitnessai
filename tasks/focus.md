# Focus: Trainer-Selectable Workout Layouts

## Priority: HIGH (Priority #2 after bug fixes which shipped 2026-02-13)

## What
Trainers choose which workout logging UI their trainees see during active workouts. Three layout variants: Classic (table overview), Card (current one-at-a-time), Minimal (compact list with quick-complete).

## Why
Different trainee experience levels need different UIs. Experienced lifters want to see all exercises at once (Classic). Beginners need the simple one-exercise-at-a-time view (Card — current default). Speed loggers doing high-volume training want minimal chrome (Minimal).

## Who Benefits
- **Trainers**: Can customize the trainee experience per client, showing professionalism and personalization
- **Trainees**: Get a workout UI optimized for their experience level and training style

## Success Metric
Trainer can set layout → trainee sees the correct layout → workout logging works identically regardless of layout
