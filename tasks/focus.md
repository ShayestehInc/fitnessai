# Pipeline 10 Focus: Web Dashboard Phase 2 — Settings, Progress Charts, Actionable Notifications & Invitations

## Priority: HIGH

## What
Complete the web trainer dashboard by filling dead UI and adding missing interactivity:
1. **Settings page** — Profile editing (name, email), theme toggle (light/dark/system), notification preferences
2. **Trainee progress charts** — Wire up the Progress tab with adherence and weight trend charts using existing backend data
3. **Notification click-through** — Clicking a notification navigates to the relevant trainee
4. **Invitation row actions** — Resend, cancel, and copy code actions per invitation

## Why
- **Dead UI hurts trust**: Settings page and Progress tab are prominently visible "Coming soon" placeholders — users click them and find nothing actionable
- **Notifications without navigation are useless**: The #1 reason to have notifications is to take you somewhere. Currently they only mark as read.
- **Invitations are read-only**: Trainers who sent to wrong email or want to remind someone have no recourse
- **Theme toggle is expected**: Dark mode works via system preference but users expect an in-app toggle

## Who Benefits
- **Trainers**: Functional settings, actionable notifications, invitation management, progress visibility
- **Platform**: Transforms the web dashboard from read-only viewer to functional management tool
