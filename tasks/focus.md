# Focus: Ambassador User Type & Referral System

## Priority: HIGH (Priority #4 — skipping Web Dashboard which is too large for single pipeline)

## What
New AMBASSADOR user role with referral system. Ambassadors sell the platform to trainers and earn monthly revenue share from each referred trainer's subscription. Complete with referral codes, revenue tracking, admin management, and ambassador dashboard.

## Why
FitnessAI's growth depends on trainer acquisition. Currently, trainers find the platform organically. An ambassador program creates a sales channel where motivated individuals recruit trainers for a recurring commission. This is a proven SaaS growth strategy (Stripe, Shopify, HubSpot all use it).

## Who Benefits
- **Ambassadors**: Earn passive income by referring trainers to the platform
- **Platform**: Scales trainer acquisition without scaling sales team
- **Trainers**: Discover the platform through trusted personal referrals

## Success Metric
Admin creates ambassador → ambassador shares referral link → trainer signs up → ambassador sees referred trainer on dashboard → ambassador earns monthly commission from trainer's subscription.
