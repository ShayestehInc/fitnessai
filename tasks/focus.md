# Pipeline 11 Focus: Web Dashboard Phase 3 — Trainer Analytics Page

## Priority: HIGH

## What
Build the Trainer Analytics page for the web dashboard. Two backend endpoints already exist (`/api/trainer/analytics/adherence/` and `/api/trainer/analytics/progress/`) with no frontend. This gives trainers aggregate visibility across all trainees — adherence rates, weight progress, and at-risk trainees — in a single dedicated page.

## Why Now
- Backend APIs already exist and are tested
- recharts is already installed from Pipeline 10
- All existing pages are feature-complete; analytics is the next logical addition
- High trainer value: identifies coaching patterns, flags at-risk trainees, and measures program effectiveness
