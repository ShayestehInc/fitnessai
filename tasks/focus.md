# Pipeline 37 Focus: Trainer Dashboard Mobile Responsiveness

## Priority
Make the **trainer web dashboard** fully mobile-friendly. The trainee portal was already optimized in Pipeline 36 — now apply the same treatment to the trainer-facing pages.

## Scope
All pages under the `(dashboard)` layout used by trainers:
- Dashboard home (stats, trainees)
- Trainee list + detail (tabs, activity, progress)
- Programs (list, builder, generator)
- Exercise bank (grid, create/edit dialogs)
- Invitations management
- Notifications
- Messages / AI Chat
- Announcements
- Branding settings
- Analytics
- Subscription / Payments
- Calendar
- Settings (profile, appearance, security)

## Key Areas
1. Tables (trainee list, invitations, notifications) — responsive on mobile
2. Dialog/modal overflow — all dialogs scrollable at mobile viewport
3. Touch targets — minimum 44px on interactive elements
4. Form layouts — stack vertically on mobile
5. Chart readability — axis labels, legends at small widths
6. Navigation — sidebar/drawer already exists, verify usability
7. Cards and grids — single column on mobile, multi-column on desktop
