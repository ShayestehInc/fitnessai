# Pipeline 9 Focus: Web Trainer Dashboard (Phase 4 Foundation)

## Priority: HIGH

## What
Build the Next.js 15 web dashboard for trainers with:
- JWT auth flow (login, auto-refresh, role gating)
- Dashboard with stats cards, recent/inactive trainees
- Trainee list with search + pagination, detail with tabs
- Notification system with polling
- Invitation management
- Responsive layout with dark mode
- Docker integration

## Why
- **Business need**: Trainers need a full browser experience to manage their business efficiently
- **Desktop workflow**: Managing many trainees is faster on desktop with larger screens
- **Data density**: Tables, stats, and multi-tab views work better on web
- **White-label prep**: Web dashboard is prerequisite for white-label infrastructure

## Who Benefits
- **Trainers**: Desktop management of trainees, invitations, notifications
- **Platform**: New channel increases engagement, enables future admin dashboard
